### Hi World, I'm Michael 👋

## About Me
I'm a full-stack developer based in sunny Los Angeles. My journey into software development started as a business analyst, where I had the opportunity to work closely with end-users, product managers, and developers to build and test applications. Seeing firsthand how software is planned, built, and integrated sparked a passion in me for coding, which led me to pursue a career in software engineering.

At App Academy, I've had the chance to hone my skills in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Javascript, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, SQL, React/Redux, and Express.js. One of my proudest projects I created thus far, is a full-stack application inspired by Medium.com - it was challenging, but incredibly rewarding to see it come to life!

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hanging out with my family and dog at the beach, or curling up with a good book. I'm passionate about building meaningful relationships with others, and I believe that the best software is created when developers work collaboratively and empathetically. Let's build something great together!
